# Remote-Work-Impact-on-Employees-Mental-Health
I conducted an in-depth analysis to assess the impact of remote work on employees’ mental health, utilizing historical survey data sourced from Kaggle. This analysis aimed to provide insights into employee demographics, industries, work modes, work hours, and mental health conditions, among others.

## 1. Data Sourcing and Preparation: 

- The analysis began by sourcing a dataset from Kaggle. To ensure the data's accuracy, I undertook a thorough cleaning process.
- This involved removing blanks and duplicates, data profiling and standardizing the data for consistency. Ensuring that the data was well prepared allowed for a robust and accurate analysis.

## 2. Data Analysis: 

- Utilizing pivot tables in Microsoft Excel, I analysed various dimensions such as employees' gender, industry, work modes, and hours worked per week.
- The analysis also considered respondents' access to mental health resources and specific mental health conditions they experienced (such as burnout, depression, or anxiety).
- This structured approach allowed me to draw key conclusions about how remote work impacts different aspects of employee wellbeing.

## 3. Visualization: 

To better communicate the findings, I built an interactive dashboard with dynamic charts that visually represented the relationships between variables such as gender, region, work hours, and access to mental health resources. These visualizations made it easier to interpret the complex data and extract actionable insights.

## 4. Reporting & Insights: 

A detailed report was created, summarizing the findings and offering recommendations. The insights derived from the data are aimed at helping organizations improve their support systems and policies for remote employees, particularly concerning mental health resources and work life balance.

## Key Insights and Recommendations:

1. Mental Health of Respondents: 

   - Burnout and anxiety were the most reported mental health conditions, with 25.60% of employees experiencing burnout and 25.56% suffering from anxiety. 

   ➡️ Recommendation: Organizations should implement regular mental health check-ins and provide burnout prevention programs to mitigate these issues.

2. Work Hours and Impact on Mental Health: 

    - Employees working 55–60 hours per week reported the highest instances of mental health conditions (13.98%). 

   ➡️ Recommendation: Companies should monitor work hours and encourage healthier work life balance by enforcing strict working hour limits or offering flexible schedules.

3. Work Mode and Mental Health: 

    - The data revealed that 34.28% of respondents work remotely, and this group reported higher levels of burnout compared to their onsite counterparts. 

   ➡️ Recommendation: Organizations with a remote workforce should consider offering remote specific mental health resources, such as virtual counselling or online support groups.

4. Access to Mental Health Resources: 

     - Interestingly, only 51.06% of respondents reported having access to mental health resources in their workplaces. 

   ➡️ Recommendation: Employers should prioritize making mental health support accessible to all employees, especially remote workers, to reduce the mental strain associated with isolation.

5. Dominant Demographics: 

   - Female employees (25.48%) and respondents from the Oceania region (34%) made up the largest groups in the survey. Additionally, 28.16% of respondents were aged 50-60. 

   ➡️ Recommendation: Tailoring mental health resources to the needs of specific demographic groups, such as older employees or females, may improve engagement and effectiveness.

## Conclusion: 

This analysis highlights the significant impact of remote work on employees’ mental health, providing valuable insights into how organizations can better support their workforce. By focusing on work life balance, offering mental health resources, and understanding the needs of their diverse employee base, companies can create healthier, more productive work environments.

This project demonstrates my ability to use real-world data to drive actionable recommendations, presenting findings in a clear and impactful manner.
